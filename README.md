# C++ Easy Socket
The “C++ Easy Socket” project was developed to make networking projects easier
by hiding all of the messy difficult stuff. It provides a higher-level of abstraction
without compromising portability in regards to libraries. It’s currently been built
and coded for Linux, however Windows compatibility will come in the near future,
as well as support for server-sided functions (eg. binding). If anyone out there
wants to help out by implementing either of these, feel free to fork the repo, I
may even put it in the official branch!

# Motivation
This class was originally implemented for an IRC client I was creating in C++. After
seeing all the code and messing around it took to use sockets, I decided to write
my own class. After I implemented the program it occurred to me this might be of
use to others. It’s by no means perfect, but improvements will be made over
time.

# Latest Version
The latest version for this project is 1.0. Further implementation such as server
support and windows support will be added in the near future.

# Requirements
This project does not require any external libraries, all you need is gcc/g++ or any
other compiler to compile the source code.
