# C++ Easy Socket
The “C++ Easy Socket” project was developed to make networking projects easier
by hiding all of the messy difficult stuff. It provides a higher-level of abstraction
without compromising portability in regards to libraries. Though it was built on
a Linux system, Windows support has been added. In the recent update 1.1, server-sided
functionality was also added. This project is for TCP connections, and currently does not
support UDP specifically.

# Motivation
This class was originally implemented for an IRC client I was creating in C++. After
seeing all the code and messing around it took to use sockets, I decided to write
my own class. After I implemented the program it occurred to me this might be of
use to others. It’s by no means perfect, but improvements will be made over
time.
